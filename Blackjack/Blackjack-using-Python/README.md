# Blackjack-using-Python

Blackjack starts by asking the user if they would like to place a bet before beginning the game play. The players are given 100 chips to start. The user makes their bet and the game begins. The cards have each been given a value. For example, the 2 of Clubs will be equal to 2 and royals shall be equal to 10 points. The Ace can either be 1 or 11 points. Get as close to or equal to 21 to win the round. Going over 21 points in a single round will result in a bust! If your hand is higher than the dealer's when you stand, you win, otherwise you lose your bet.

Game Play
To play a hand of Blackjack the following steps must be followed:

Create a deck of 52 cards
Shuffle the deck
Ask the Player for their bet
Make sure that the Player's bet does not exceed their available chips
Deal two cards to the Dealer and two cards to the Player
Show only one of the Dealer's cards, the other remains hidden
Show both of the Player's cards
Ask the Player if they wish to Hit, and take another card
If the Player's hand doesn't Bust (go over 21), ask if they'd like to Hit again.
If a Player Stands, play the Dealer's hand. The dealer will always Hit until the Dealer's value meets or exceeds 17
Determine the winner and adjust the Player's chips accordingly
Ask the Player if they'd like to play again
